# Happeat

## What the Project Does
Happeat is a web platform designed to address the pressing issues of food wastage and food scarcity by facilitating the redistribution of surplus food resources. It connects surplus food providers such as restaurants, supermarkets, and individuals with those in need, enabling the efficient transfer of excess food at discounted prices and good quality.

## Why the Project is Useful
The project is valuable for several reasons:
- Reduces Food Waste: By providing a platform for businesses and individuals to sell their surplus food at a lower price, Happeat helps prevent perfectly good food from going to waste.
- Alleviates Food Scarcity: Individuals and organizations in need can access affordable, high-quality food through Happeat, helping to combat hunger and food insecurity in communities.
- Promotes Sustainability: By encouraging the reuse of surplus food, Happeat contributes to a more sustainable and environmentally friendly food system.

## Technologies Used
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript: Frontend development for the website.
- Webflow: Design and prototyping tool for building responsive web layouts..
